## About me
 My name is **Adriana Kuczaj** and I am currently in the first year of studies at the University of Economics in Wroc≈Çaw. My major is IT in Business.

 In addition to my studies, I also try to pursue various courses and workshops to develop my knowledge and programming skills.

## Project aim

 This page was created to remember the material from the online course I am a participant of. The course was created by **YouCode** - Internet Programing School.

## How to use website
On the website you can read and learn more about me. Get to know my interests, favorite movies and some ideas for boredom. 

In the future, I plan to expand the website more and change the layout.

## Demo
Check out how it works :)
